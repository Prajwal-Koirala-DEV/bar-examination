### What are the basic things that need to be proven for an intentional tort?

To prove an intentional tort, the following elements must be established:

1. **Intent**: The defendant either meant to commit the act or knew that it was highly likely to result in harm.
2. **Act**: The defendant engaged in a specific action that directly resulted in harm or injury.
3. **Causation**: The defendant's act directly caused the harm or injury that occurred, meaning there must be a direct link between the act and the harm.
4. **Harm or Injury**: Actual harm or injury must have occurred to the plaintiff, which can be physical, emotional, or otherwise.

These elements are generally required to establish liability for an intentional tort, although they may vary slightly depending on the specific type of tort (e.g., battery, assault, false imprisonment, etc.).

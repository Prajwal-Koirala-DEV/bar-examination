### What are the basic things that need to be proven for an intentional tort?

To prove an intentional tort, the following elements must be established:

1. **Intent**: The person either meant to commit the act or knew that it was highly likely to result in harm.
2. **Act**: The person engaged in a specific action that led to harm.
3. **Causation**: The personâ€™s act directly caused the harm or injury that occurred.
4. **Harm**: Actual harm or injury was caused to another person as a result of the act.

These four elements must be demonstrated to establish liability for an intentional tort.

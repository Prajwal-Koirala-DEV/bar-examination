### What are the basic things that need to be proven for an intentional tort?

To prove an intentional tort, the following elements must be established:

1. **Intent**: The defendant either meant to commit the act or knew that it was highly likely to result in harm.
2. **Act**: The defendant engaged in a specific action that directly resulted in harm or injury.
3. **Causation**: The defendant's act directly caused the harm or injury that occurred, meaning there must be a direct link between the act and the harm.
4. **Harm or Injury**: Actual harm or injury must have occurred to the plaintiff, which can be physical, emotional, or otherwise.

These elements are generally required to establish liability for an intentional tort, although they may vary slightly depending on the specific type of tort (e.g., battery, assault, false imprisonment, etc.).

### What intent is needed for intentional torts?

For intentional torts, the key element is **intent**. Specifically, the person committing the tort must have the **purpose** or **knowledge** that their actions are substantially certain to cause a harmful result. There are two main types of intent that can be relevant:

1. **Specific Intent**: The person acts with the purpose of bringing about a specific result. For example, if someone intentionally hits another person with the intent to harm them, the intent is specific.
2. **General Intent**: The person acts knowing that their actions are substantially certain to result in harm, even if they do not specifically desire that result. For example, if someone throws a rock into a crowd, they may not aim to hit anyone but are aware that the act is likely to cause harm.

In short, for an intentional tort to occur, the defendant must either:

- Act with the purpose of causing a harmful consequence, or
- Act with knowledge that their conduct is substantially certain to result in such a consequence.

This intent element is central to distinguishing intentional torts (like battery, assault, false imprisonment, etc.) from negligence or strict liability torts, where intent is not required.

### Are children and the mentally incompetent liable for their own torts?

Children and mentally incompetent individuals can be held **liable** for their actions in intentional torts, but their liability is treated differently from adults. Here's a breakdown of how the law generally applies to these groups:

### 1. **Children**

Children can be held liable for **intentional torts** (such as battery or assault) if they have the **intent** necessary for the tort, but their liability may be influenced by their age, understanding, and ability to appreciate the consequences of their actions.

- **Age Considerations**: The law recognizes that children may not have the same understanding, maturity, or capacity to form the requisite intent as adults. As a result, in many jurisdictions, children under a certain age (typically around 7) are presumed incapable of forming the intent necessary to commit a tort.

  - **Young children** (e.g., under 7 years old) may be **presumed incapable** of forming the intent required for an intentional tort, and thus generally cannot be held liable for such torts.

  - **Older children** (above the age of 7) may be held **liable** if they can be shown to have the requisite intent or understanding of the consequences of their actions. The ability of a child to form intent is typically judged based on their age and maturity.

- **Reasonable Child Standard**: In some cases, the child’s conduct may be compared to what a "reasonable child" of similar age, intelligence, and experience would do in the same situation. This is more relevant to negligence than intentional torts, but it still influences how children's actions are viewed.

### 2. **Mentally Incompetent Individuals**

Mentally incompetent individuals, including those with severe mental impairments, can also be held liable for intentional torts, but there are exceptions.

- **Liability for Intentional Acts**: A mentally incompetent person can still be held **liable for their intentional actions** if they have the requisite intent to commit the tort. Just like any other individual, if they act with the intent to cause harm, they may be liable for an intentional tort, regardless of their mental state.
- **Test for Mental Competence**: The key issue is whether the individual had the **capacity to form the intent** for the tort. If the person is mentally impaired but still has the mental ability to understand that their actions are likely to cause harm (or if they act with a specific purpose), they may be held liable.

  - In cases where an individual’s mental competence is in question, courts may look at whether the person knew what they were doing and understood the consequences of their actions.

  - If the person is deemed **legally insane** (unable to appreciate the nature and quality of their actions or understand that their actions are wrong), they may have a **defense** to liability under some legal systems. This would generally apply in criminal law (e.g., insanity defense), but it may influence civil liability as well, depending on the jurisdiction.

### Conclusion:

- **Children**: Can be liable for intentional torts if they have the required intent, though liability is typically based on their age and capacity to form intent.
- **Mentally Incompetent Individuals**: Can be held liable for intentional torts if they have the necessary intent, but may have a defense if they lack the capacity to understand the consequences of their actions due to mental incompetence.

In both cases, intent plays a critical role, and the capacity to form intent is key to determining liability.
